Welcome to the RBUD 1.0 tutorial, which provides
software, documentation, and tutorial for method for microbial
community profiling developed by Zhikai Xing. Most tools are supported
as individual software packages (typically `Python`,`Perl` or `R`). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **1. Requirements**

- Linux
- SOAPaligner/soap2
- BLAST/Diamond

**Note:** MDGM database is essential for RBUD method. For the purpose to study bacteria, viruses and fungus separately, we provided codes to establish a separated database that can save time and improve degree of accuracy. Befoe you use RBUD method, you should build your development envrionment in Linux. In addition, SOAPaligner/soap2 should be installed. 

## **2. MDGM database** 

### **2.1 MDGM database introduction**

MDGM database includes Species dataset and Functional dataset. The functional dataset contains gene annotation information from different databases. The folder is called Annotation Database, including information from Antibiotic Resistance Gene Database (ARDB), The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database(CARD), Carbohydrate-Active enZymes Database (CAZy)，eggNOG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Universal Protein (UniProt), Metabolic Pathways From all Domains of Life (MetaCyc). In additon, we provide a file called linkdb_genes, the users can link it with gene ID, GI ID and protein ID to find the comments.The method of establishing the database and the running code gave as follows.

### **2.2 The code of MDGM database construction**

### **2.2.1 Download microbial data**

you should download all microorganism data from NCBI,the data should includ the suffixes of .fna, .gbk, .ffn, .gff. In this process, all microorganism contain archaea, bacteria, fungi, virus.

### **2.2.2 Create binary of reference genome for species dataset**

it is for creating binary of reference genome for species dataset.(2bwt-builder-species.sh)

	> cd /MDGM database/Species dataset/Sequence/NCBI_Species
	> tar -xvf all.fna.tar
	> cat * >all.fna
	> 2bwt-builder all.fna
	
**Note:** In this step, you can divided all.fna into four groups to improve the speed of alignment.

### **2.2.3 Extract the species taxonomy annotation**

it is for extracting the species annotation.(species_annotation.pl)

	> cd /MDGM database/Species dataset/Annotation/NCBI species annotation

According to gene ID, GI ID and protein ID to find the annotation in databases of ARDB, CARD, CAZy, COG, KEGG, UniProt, MetaCyc. If you can't find the annotation, it is the best way to align DNA sequence to these databases for functional annotation using blast software. Finally, based on the above biological information to construct MDGM database.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Runing RBUD Method** 

### **3.1 Calculate the length of microbial genome and CDS sequence**

Based on above sequence of all.fna and all.ffn, a script of length.py is used to extract the length of every microbial genome and CDS sequence separately.

	> python /RBUD code/RBUD running code/length.py
	
**Note:** In this step, species_length and function_length are obtained for the length of every microbial gneome and CDS sequence separately using this script.

### **3.2 Alignment next generation sequencing data with MDGM database using SOAPaligner/soap2**

Before use soap2 to do alignment, the reference index must be generated by 2bwt-builder. These steps follow as parts of 2.2.2 and 2.2.4.

#### **3.2.1 Align query sequence with microbial genome**

Before you use RBUD method, you should align query sequence with microbial genome and store output.(all.fna)

	> soap -a query.fastq -D /MDGM database/Species dataset/Sequence/NCBI_Species/all.fna.index -o species.soap -r 2 -m 200 -x 1000
	>soap -a query_forward.fastq -b query_reverse.fastq -D /MDGM database/Species dataset/Sequence/NCBI_Species/all.fna.index -o species.soap -2 unalign_species.sop -r 2 -m 200 -x 1000

#### **3.2.2 Align query sequence with CDS sequence**

Before you use RBUD method, you should align query sequence with CDS sequence and store output.(all.ffn)

	> soap -a query.fastq -D /MDGM database/Functional dataset/Sequence/NCBI_CDS/all.ffn.index -o gene.soap -r 2 -m 200 -x 1000
	>soap -a query_forward.fastq -b query_reverse.fastq -D /MDGM database/Functional dataset/Sequence/NCBI_CDS/all.ffn.index -o gene.soap -2 unalign_gene.sop -r 2 -m 200 -x 1000
	
**Note:** The first command is applicable to single-end sequencing and the second command is suitable for paired-end sequencing. SOAP2 output format contains following column information: reads name/reads ID, reads sequence, sequence quality, number of optimal comparison, a/b: mark of comparison for pair-end reads, read length, +/-: the chain of reference sequence, chromosome name, location of chromosome, number of mismatch, mismatch details, number of match, comparison details.

### **3.3 Running RBUD method**

A script for RBUD method. length_file is the length of every items of reference sequence that aligned by sequencing data, including species_length and function_length. input_file is the comparison results by SOAPaligner/soap2. output_file is the abundance of species or genes.In addition,you could run "python RBUD.py -h" for searching help.

Commands:

	> python RBUD.py -l length_file -i input_file -o output_file

**Note:** In this step, you can obtain species abundance and gene abundance using RBUD.py script.

### **3.4 Comparison analysis in your metagenomic research**

Based on the results of RBUD method, you could use other statistical tools/softwares to compare the difference in your metagenomic research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **4. Other tools for meta'omic profiling**

### **4.1 Microbial community profiling**

This set of methods generally provide reference-based profiles of
microbial community features, e.g. taxonomic abundances (MetaPhlAn) or
functional profiles (genes and/or pathways, HUMAnN). They apply broadly
to sequence-based data (metagenomes and metatranscriptomes), with some
methods applying to other types of culture-independent molecular data.
