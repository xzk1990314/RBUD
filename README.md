# RBUD
RBUD - a new functional potential analysis approach for whole microbial genome shotgun sequencing
MDGM database has two datasets, including Species dataset and Functional dataset. Each dataset consists of two floders of Sequence and Annotation. In functional dataset, we added gene annotation information of different database inf the folder named Annotation Database, containg ARDB, CARD,CAZy,COG,eggNOG,KEGG. Moreover, we provided a folder named linkdb_genes for find the annotation of the above database by gene id ,gi id and protein id.
